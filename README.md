# RGUHack2020
## Inspiration
We were inspired by our love for adventure and story telling which we wanted to bring to life in our game.
## What it does
It tells the story of Jessica, and the tragedy that befell her. The player must solve what happened to her, or die trying.
## How I built it
With a mixture of CSS, HTML, Javascript and caffeine.
## Challenges I ran into
Getting the game to function how we wanted it to, and look how we wanted it to was a long and difficult challenge, but we got it to work.
## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Managing to get the game to be fully functional in the end is something we are very proud of, it wasn't easy and we are proud we did not give up when things got difficult.
## What I learned
In this event we learned how to make a text based game - all of the steps from planning to coding. We learned to persevere even when we thought we couldn't keep going and it would be impossible.
## What's next for Alert
We could develop it into a mobile app, and add in extra branches and endings to the story to create an even more immersive and dynamic world.
